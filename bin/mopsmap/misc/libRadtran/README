This directory shows an example how to use the netcdf files created by MOPSMAP in the radiative transfer model uvspec available at http://libradtran.org

mopsmap_example.inp shows a simple example to create such a netcdf file with MOPSMAP. You need to adjust the paths in this file.

aerosol_optics.cdf is the output file created by MOPSMAP in this example.

After you have installed libRadtran - see http://libradtran.org for details - you can use uvspec_example.inp to model the radiative transfer for a simple example.
Running uvspec is usually done with the following command:
PATH_TO_LIBRADTRAN/bin/uvspec < uvspec_example.inp
You need to adjust the paths here and in the file.

Please consult the libRadtran user's guide to adjust the example to your needs and to learn how to interpret the uvspec output.
