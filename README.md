# Pymopsmap - a python wrapper for the Mopsmap library
![Mopsmap](https://mopsmap.net/) is a Fortran library based on a large dataset of pre-calculated optical parameters. It enables computing optical properties of user-defined particles ensembles. 
Pymopsmap is a python wrapper for Mopsmap, that allows to compute optical parameters from user-defined particle ensemble. It also adds some adapting tools in order to generate specific LUTs (Look Up Tables) 
of optical parameters from input sources such as CAMS.
